              <p> DETAILS:</p>
        <p>The Pollock Gallery of the Division of Art at SMU Meadows School of the Arts will present the exhibition Lorem Ipsum from November 7 through December 12.

In graphic design, the jumbled Latin phrase “lorem ipsum” is used as a placeholder in advance of finished text. Designers employ this language in order to focus attention on the structural elements of a layout, such as typography, without being distracted by readable content. Much like its graphic usage, Lorem Ipsum will be a work in progress designed to expose the conceptual and logistical mechanisms of an exhibition.

Conceived as a collaborative curatorial experiment, Lorem Ipsum will be an ongoing dialogue among a group of curators selected from various backgrounds (academia, non-profit, commercial gallery, museum); differing locations; and with interests and experiences in multiple creative ventures, who will function as representatives of the breadth of contemporary curatorial practice. They have selected a variety of contemporary artworks from 19 artists, including two-dimensional works, sculptures, videos and installations. During the course of the exhibition, the curators will play a game: They will take turns reworking and recontextualizing the art objects with the purpose of creating a running commentary about what it is to be a curator at this point in time. Images of the changes made by the curators will be posted regularl</p>
